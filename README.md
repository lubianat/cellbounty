# cellbounty
A bounty of 01 beer (or coffee, or tea, or juice) when we meet for anyone that sends me articles about new cell types native of some vertebrates, mentioned in published researched, not catalogued on Wikidata. 

And yes, it is cumulative. It is capped at 2 liters of beverage/person, though.
